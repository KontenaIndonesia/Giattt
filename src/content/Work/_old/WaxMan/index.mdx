### WaxMan – Hybrid Web App

This prototype was designed to show how a data-rich enterprise application could still employ beautiful and contemporary visual design.  Built for a fictitious chain of high-end supermarkets in Southern California, the application allows a store owner to find, dynamically filter, and compare sales and demographic data across a number of locations.

This was intended as an internal tool to help educate engineers and sales folk on the direction data-rich applications are taking — it’s no longer enough to simply allow users to easily access data; today their expectations include modern interactive models (dynamic filtering, drag-and-drop functionality, etc.) and compelling visual design.
