## Problem/Goal:
### Employers:  
Employers struggle to effectively identify, communicate with and gain access to transitioning and unemployed service members who have the skills they seek.
### Veterans: 
Corporate Military “speak” does not align with Commercial skill descriptions

## Research:
- SkillMil offers precision hiring of the right skill mapped to the right job for high performance hiring

## Ideation:
- what explorations did you do? How did your research shape your ideas?

## Deliverables:
- what does the final product look like? Did you make a prototype? Did it ship? If not, why not?

## What’s next?:
- if you had more time, what would you do next?

## Wireframes:
- what kind of design decisions did you make? How does this affect the users?
