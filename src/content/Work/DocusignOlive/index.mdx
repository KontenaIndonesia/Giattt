As DocuSign's official design system, Olive serves a wide range of designers and developers building digital products and experiences. The goals of the system include improving UI consistency and quality, making the design and development process more efficient and focused, establishing a shared vocabulary between designer and developer, and providing clear, discoverable guidance around design and development best practices.

With the DocuSign Design Language as its foundation, the system consists of working code, design tools and resources, human interface guidelines, and a vibrant community of contributors.

## Process Image
  - Let's get together to map out how developers use and contribute to Olive so we can refine and communicate our process to the org— with the ultimate goal of increasing the efficiency of Olive and feature dev teams.
  - Agenda:
    - Align on an end-to-end process map of what it’s like to use Olive as a developer from first day on the job to shipping a finished feature. 
    - Identify friction points in the flow.
    - Propose and rank potential solutions to friction points.
    Review and prioritize backlog of solutions for the coming quarter.
