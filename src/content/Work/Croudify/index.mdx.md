- Croudify is peer to peer investing web platform startup. I work very closely with CEO through brainstorming sessions and wireframe deliverables, I assisted the team for branding of startup, website design and product design and user experience.

- I designed monochromatic color palette for Croudify branding and product. I sketched landing and sign up page after brainstorming with Croudify team and converted them into wireframes.

- Landing website page : Designed and developed interactive landing page with full-width video in background. I take care of web optimization and performance of Croudify website and signup page.

- One Page Sign Up : I designed and developed single page signup for simplify user experience with rich and intuitive interactions. I also take care of email, password and other registration validation.

- Dashboard : Dashboards have become the front-end and first line of access to business intelligence and often the best way to gain insight into an organization’s operations and performance. Depending on your business challenges and the overall goals of your dashboard implementation, the type of solution you choose will differ. I designed a dashboard to help users understand the information that’s important to them to make right investment decisions.
