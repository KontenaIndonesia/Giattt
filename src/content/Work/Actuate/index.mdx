## Aviatio

<ImageWrap srcName="ActuateWhiteBoard"/>

- Aviatio is a desktop and tablet app that allows users to explore data on flight and airport performance across the U.S. It’s a pretty simple interface: you select a region and then a state to view a state-specific dashboard.

- We developed this to showcase certain aspects of Actuate’s REST API library and also to demonstrate how BIRT technology could be used in a cross-device, responsive design.

- The little airplane animation on the loading screen was added after it became clear that the dashboards were taking a long time to generate over remote connections. It’s now the feature that most people tell me they like — rather an unexpected response, but a nice illustration of how a touch of whimsy can elevate an otherwise straightforward app.

- Responsibilities: I was in charge of developing responsive web/mobile application using BIRT REST APIs, HTML, and Java Script for different platforms (mobile, tablet and web). Since this project was medium-small, it was a team of four. I worked closely with visual designer, interaction designer , and back-end engineer.

- Challenges: The most challenging of the project were time and resources. We had four weeks to complete everything. With these constraints, the solution was to design appealing interaction and interface. Every element has purpose at the same time it meets the requirements. The navigation is using live data on iHub. The charts are report content, which showcase product capabilities.

## Gazetteer

- The UN Data App was developed to demonstrate how a client could build a REST API into an application created with our software. Using data gathered by the UN, we designed and developed an app that lets the user explore statistics about individual continents, regions, and countries around the world. The app allows the user to either navigate through a traditional menu structure or make selections by interacting with a map. The user can then drill deeper to view a report about the region they have selected and compare it to others.

- Drawing on World Bank figures, the app allowed users to explore decades of demographic data using either a map-based atlas interface or a more traditional drill-down menu. Either route would bring the user to a detailed report at the world, continent, region, or country level.

- It’s a native IOS application, which embedded BIRT content and pulled live data from iHub server. This reference app was a showcase on how to integrate Actuate technology into a native application by using APIs (REST and JSAPI).

- Responsibilities: I was working with a lead developer for this app. Once the concept was finalized and approved, I was in charge of developing it to deploy it to Apple iStore.

- Challenges: The only challenge was the cross code between IOS and web. From what I understand, they can’t be combined on the same page but possible on the same app. With this restriction, UX had to accommodate the code to be able to reach the goal and achieve the odds. The flows were clearly separated by one navigation button. Strengthen with consistent interface that makes the experience feel smoother throughout the app.
